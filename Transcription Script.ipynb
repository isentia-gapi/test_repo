for\\n\\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.960\\nOne person in our team\\n\\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.960\\nWho is looking out for any jobs\\n\\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.960\\nWe are currently hiring for a content creator\\n\\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.960\\nSo maybe I can let Fadlur explain a little bit more about our creative team\\n\\n00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.960\\nOkay, thank you\\n\\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.960\\nWe are already looking for a content creator\\n\\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.960\\nWho is interested especially in TikTok\\n\\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.960\\nTikTok creation, video creation, content creation\\n\\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.960\\nAnd obviously it doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman\\n\\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.960\\nI have a candidate\\n\\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.960\\nReally?\\n\\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.960\\nSimon Boy\\n\\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.960\\nThat's great\\n\\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960\\nI have a candidate\\n\\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.960\\nI have a candidate\\n\\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.960\\nThe one we discussed earlier\\n\\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.960\\nI have a candidate\\n\\n00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.960\\nSure, sure\\n\\n00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.960\\nI think Miza\\n\\n00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.960\\nMiza really wants to know\\n\\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.960\\nIt doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman\\n\\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.960\\nHe or she needs to know\\n\\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.960\\nAbout how to do content\\n\\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960\\nAnd the trend here\\n\\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.960\\nThe trend now\\n\\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960\\nBecause every week\\n\\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.960\\nIt will change\\n\\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.960\\nOver and over again\\n\\n00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.960\\nSo he or she must be adaptive\\n\\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.960\\nTo whatever trend news\\n\\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960\\nAnything that relates to\\n\\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.960\\nEspecially shortcuts\\n\\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.960\\nAge doesn't matter\\n\\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960\\nAge doesn't matter?\\n\\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.960\\nAge doesn't matter\\n\\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.960\\nBut\\n\\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960\\nI have a TikTok\\n\\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960\\nI think it should be\\n\\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960\\nIt should be young\\n\\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.960\\nYoung\\n\\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.960\\nThose that are active on social media\\n\\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.960\\nYes\\n\\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960\\nThose that are not camera shy\\n\\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.960\\nThat's very important\\n\\n00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960\\nAnd that is very good\\n\\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960\\nAt video editing also\\n\\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.960\\nThat will be a first point\\n\\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.960\\nAnd\\n\\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.960\\nThose that can vibe with us\\n\\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960\\nOf course, that's very important\\n\\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.960\\nI have a candidate\\n\\n00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.960\\nWho is this?\\n\\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.960\\nDo you know her?\\n\\n00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.960\\nScandalbullets\\n\\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960\\nShe's funny\\n\\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.960\\nDo you know her?\\n\\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.960\\nShe said no, no, no\\n\\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.960\\nSo what does it mean?\\n\\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.960\\nWorking in the office\\n\\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.960\\nMaking daily content\\n\\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.960\\nFor TikTok or what?\\n\\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.960\\nTikTok live or what?\\n\\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.960\\nSo\\n\\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.960\\nThe current job scope that we're hiring\\n\\n00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.960\\nIs a full-time job\\n\\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.960\\nSo\\n\\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960\\nWe'll be working\\n\\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960\\nClosely together with Fad\\n\\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.960\\nAnd our creative team\\n\\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960\\nMarketing team\\n\\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.960\\nWe have videographer in-house, everything\\n\\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.960\\nThat's the start\\n\\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.960\\nThis one can't\\n\\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.960\\nBecause it's full-time and has shortcuts\\n\\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.960\\nFad, how is working with Miza?\\n\\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.960\\nIs Miza fierce as a boss?\\n\\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.960\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960\\nExperience\\n\\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.960\\nMiza is fierce\\n\\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.960\\nShe's fierce when we do things\\n\\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.960\\nBut the thing is\\n\\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.960\\nBecause we're a small team\\n\\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.960\\nWe're a marketing team\\n\\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.960\\nWe're all born together\\n\\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.960\\nWe even have\\n\\n00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.960\\nA videographer from KL\\n\\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.960\\nWe always want to call him Balik\\n\\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960\\nBecause it's fun\\n\\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.960\\nIt's fun\\n\\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.960\\nAnd then I think\\n\\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.960\\nIt's more of the bonding\\n\\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960\\nThat we have\\n\\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.960\\nI think it's very fun, it's very young\\n\\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.960\\nAnd\\n\\n00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960\\nIt doesn't matter if the idea is not from me\\n\\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.960\\nOr from the marketing team\\n\\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960\\nBut we think, hey, it works\\n\\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960\\nLet's do it, let's try\\n\\n00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.960\\nYeah, and then\\n\\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.960\\nIt's shocking\\n\\n00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.960\\nI think every day we're on WhatsApp\\n\\n00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.960\\nWe're always laughing\\n\\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.960\\nWe're always laughing here\\n\\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.960\\nEven our HR team will join\\n\\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.960\\nInto the TikTok\\n\\n00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.960\\nIt's fun\\n\\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.960\\nIt's really really fun\\n\\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.960\\nAnd anyone who wants to be\\n\\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.960\\nYou know, to be part of\\n\\n00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960\\nOur shortcuts team, I think\\n\\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.960\\nHe or she should be\\n\\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.960\\nNot camera shy\\n\\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.960\\nAt all\\n\\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.960\\nAnd always, you know, be creative\\n\\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960\\nAnd also able to\\n\\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960\\nDo TikTok live\\n\\n00:13:54.960

00:14:02.960\\nBe positive, actually be positive\\n\\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.960\\nOf course\\n\\n00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960\\nAs long as there's no\\n\\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.960\\nToxic people\\n\\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960\\nYes, of course\\n\\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960\\nIf there are people, there must be toxic\\n\\n00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960\\nIf there are people\\n\\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960\\nIf there are people, there will be politics\\n\\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.960\\nThere will be toxic\\n\\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.960\\nGod willing, no\\n\\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.960\\nHow much is your salary?\\n\\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960\\nOkay, so our\\n\\n00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960\\nSalary range\\n\\n00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960\\nStarts from\\n\\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.960\\n3k to 4.5k\\n\\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960\\nThat's a lot\\n\\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960\\nBut it depends on\\n\\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960\\nOh my God\\n\\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.960\\nIt depends on your\\n\\n00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.960\\nExperience\\n\\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.960\\nGo on\\n\\n00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.960\\nIt depends on your experience\\n\\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.960\\nWe will also\\n\\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960\\nSee how's your creativity\\n\\n00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.960\\nLike\\n\\n00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.960\\nBecause in this position\\n\\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.960\\nWe have to use a lot of creative ideas\\n\\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.960\\nWe have to think out of the box\\n\\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960\\nFor every content that we want\\n\\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.960\\nTo execute\\n\\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.960\\nBut the most important thing\\n\\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960\\nYou have to be fun\\n\\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.960\\nAre there CPF?\\n\\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960\\nWho are they?\\n\\n00:15:14.960 -->
